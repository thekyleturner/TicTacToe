TIC-TAC-TOE

A simple tic-tac-toe program. The dimensions of the board and the number of sequential spaces is supplied by the user. It randomly assigns moves for player one and player two. The user must supply input, and the number of sequential spaces to win cannot exceed the dimensions of the board separated by spaces. By default the program only announces the winner but the output of the game can be displayed if the user specifies.

Getting Started:
Run ttt.exe and specify the size of the board first, followed by the number of spaces needed to win, optionally followed by v to print the board at the finish of the game.

Examples: 
ttt.exe 3 3
ttt.exe 4 3 v

Testing for this program is included in the code and not as a separate unit testing suite/program.

Built with: 
C# in Visual Studio 2017
